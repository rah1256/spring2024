# Testimonials from Spring 2024 Students

My advice for future students taking this course is to complete the early assignments given in this course so that you are able to focus on using the information from this course in a way that interests you.  My second piece of advice builds of the first and this is to think about how this course relates to your insterests and future.  This class offers important information that other courses do not most importantly in my opinion is that you learn how github works and how to use it as this makes doing personal projects much easier.
